# ReactJS To-Do List App

## Overview

The **ReactJS To-Do List App** is a basic yet functional task management application built using **ReactJS**. It helps you keep track of tasks by allowing you to add, edit, and delete them easily. This project is a great starting point for learning React and understanding how components, state management, and events work in ReactJS.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can input new tasks using the task input field.
- **Delete Tasks**: Easily remove tasks when they're no longer needed by clicking a delete button.
- **Mark as Complete**: Toggle tasks as "completed" to visually distinguish between pending and finished tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: For creating components and handling the UI updates.
- **CSS**: For basic styling of the task list.
- **JavaScript**: To manage the logic behind adding, deleting, and marking tasks as complete.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fsenzol/reactjs-todolist.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd reactjs-todolist
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app will now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Future Improvements

- **Task Editing**: Add a feature to allow users to edit existing tasks.
- **Task Filters**: Add the ability to filter tasks based on their completion status (e.g., show only completed tasks).
